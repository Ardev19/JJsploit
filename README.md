# ggpo-roblox

***WIP, who knows if I'll ever finish it***




ggpo-roblox is a semi-direct port of [ggpo](https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo) to lua for use in Roblox

the main difference between ggpo-roblox and ggpo is that any connected network topology is support (as oppose to only a fully connected graph), and peers need not also be players

this was basically just to support roblox which has a non-player centralized server that needs to route everything

the main implementation is roblox-agnostic, so you could in principle use it outside af Roblox but I'm not going to bother testing/supporting that
